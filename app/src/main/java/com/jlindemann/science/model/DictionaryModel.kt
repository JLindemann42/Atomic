The standard atomic weight of each chemical element is determined and published by the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) based on natural, stable, terrestrial sources of the element. It is the most common and practical atomic weight used by scientists.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_atomic_weight"))

Since the boundary is not a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius. Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are: Van der Waals radius, ionic radius, and covalent radius.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius"))
